# ofxOpenALSoundPlayer
OpenAL based sound player from ofxTimeline. Exposes both buffer and has some nice FFT support for visuals.


This is the openAL sound player from https://github.com/YCAMInterlab/ofxTimeline

Slightly tweaked to stand alone.

OSX only. Add OpenAL framework
For 64bit install libsndfile with 
```
brew install libsndfile
```
The libsndfile.dylib needs recompiling for portability. Pull requests welcome.
